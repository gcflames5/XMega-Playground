Atxmega Playground
====
This board aims to serve as a space where users can test and learn embedded C, providing the means to utilizie most of the Atmel XMega AVR microcontroller's functionality. This particular project uses the ATXMega32a4u microcontroller. It aims to implement most of the communication protocols that the MCU is capable of as well as including some other peripherals.
